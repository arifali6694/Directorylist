# Introduction

- Scans the directory and subdirectories and looks for any files that are below a directory called TESTS with the extension .XYZ

- Any files that are in a SRC directory or DATA directory below the TESTS directory are ignored
- Sorts the files by size and writes an ordered list to the console
- Each file is parsed and a count is performed of:
- How many lines are in the file in total
- How many blank lines there are
- How many lines there are beginning with --
- The results should be output to the console as each file is parsed
Once all files are parsed, then a summary total should be output to the console
- All code should be commented and be structured into objects and methods
- The code should be written as if it were to be used in a production system, so please consider anything extra that you may need to do.
