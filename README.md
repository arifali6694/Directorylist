# Directorylist
- cmake is used for compilation.
- open terminal and type `cd directorylist`, then  `cmake -S. -Bbuild` to build make files from `CMakeLists.txt`
- in the same directory type `make -C build && build/main` to build and run executable.
- `testdata` folder should be in `directorylist` folder.
